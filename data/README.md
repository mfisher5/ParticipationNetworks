# Data

Data (primarily as .csv files) and R objects. The directory structure is as follows:

**input**: pre-processed fish ticket data and vessel length data for identifying metiers and building networks, along with ancillary data on crab seasons and port groups

**intermediate_metiers**: intermediate data files saved during `infomap` and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) processes

**networks**: matrix files and R objects which can be used to build (1) directed vessel flow networks and (2) fisheries participation networks in R.

**raw**: raw fish ticket data and vessel registration data from [PacFIN](http://pacfin.psmfc.org/), accessed with direct permission from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.

Some data (primarily raw and input data) includes non-aggregated, confidential information on individual vessels, and so cannot be publicly provided here. Information on confidential fishery landings data collected and stored by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, including data sharing request forms, can be found on their [website](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Marine/MFSU#48329363-overview--background).
