## Data: Fisheries Participation Networks

Undirected participation networks provide a snapshot of cross-fishery participation by a group of fishing vessels ([view guide](https://github.com/mfisher5/ParticipationNetworks/blob/master/doc/Guide_To_Undirected_Networks.md)).

The `igraph` network objects, which include network structure and additional information for nodes and edges (i.e. weights, colors) are saved as `.rds`.

Files are named using the following template: `igraph_[PortGroupCode]_[CrabYear]_[Season]_version`. You can ignore the version information.
