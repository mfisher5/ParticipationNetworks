## Data: Networks

Adjacency matrix data files and R objects which are used to build:
1. undirected fisheries participation networks (**participation**)
2. directed participation networks (**vessel_flow**)

Adjacency matrices, the data used to build network objects, should be saved as `.csv` files. The `igraph` network objects, which include network structure and additional information for nodes and edges (i.e. weights, colors) are saved as `.rds`.
