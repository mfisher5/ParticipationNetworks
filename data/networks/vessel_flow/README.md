## Data: Directed Participation Networks

Directed networks summarise and visualize changes in fishery participation undertaken by a subset of vessels from one fishing season to the next ([view guide](https://github.com/mfisher5/ParticipationNetworks/blob/master/doc/Guide_To_Directed_Networks.md)).. 

Adjacency matrices, the data used to build network objects, are be saved as `.csv` files. The `graph` network objects, which include network structure and additional information for nodes and edges (i.e. weights, colors) are saved with the `.rds` extension. 

.csv files are named using the following template: `[PortGroupCode]_[Season]_Amat_noncon_[VesselSize]'. You can ignore the version information.
.rds files are named using the following template: `[PortGroupCode]_[Season]_[VesselSize]_version'. You can ignore the version information.
