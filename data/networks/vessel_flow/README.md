## Data: Directed Participation Networks

Directed networks summarise and visualize changes in fishery participation undertaken by a subset of vessels from one fishing season to the next. 

Adjacency matrices, the data used to build network objects, are be saved as `.csv` files. The `igraph` network objects, which include network structure and additional information for nodes and edges (i.e. weights, colors) are saved as `.rds`. 

Files are named using the following template: `PortGroupCode_Season_VesselSize_version'
