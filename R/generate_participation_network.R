#' Generate Participation Network
#'
#' Create a fisheries participation network. Based on original function by 
#' Emma Fuller; edits specified in comments.
#'
#' @param tickets fish tickets data frame
#' @param pcid_choose specify a port group
#' @param year_choose Specify a crab year
#' @param filter use the `min_vessels` and `min_contribution` objects to filter the data
#' @param filter_subgraph a filtering option from the original function that was turned off for Fisher et al.
#' @param min_vessels the minimum number of vessels participating in a fishery for that fishery to be retained in the network
#' @param min_contribution the minimum contribution (as a proportion) to total exvessel revenue for a fishery to be retained for a given vessel
#' @return non-confidential fisheries partition network as an igraph object
