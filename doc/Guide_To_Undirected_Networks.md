# Guide to Undirected Networks: Cross-Fishery Participation

Undirected networks summarize patterns of resource use in fishing communities by quantifying cross-fishery participation by fishing vessels. These networks make it possible to explore fisheries connectivity, and apply established network theory to a fisheries social-ecological system. In Fisher et al. (in revision), we constructed undirected networks for each California port group and crab year to quantify temporal changes in the structure of commercial cross-fishery participation.

## Basic Network Structure

The ***nodes*** of the network are composed of fisheries.

The ***edges*** of the network indicate shared vessel participation between pairs of fisheries. Vessels are included in multiple edges of a network if they participate in three or more fisheries.

<br>

## Confidentiality

To protect the confidentiality of the data, edges and fishery nodes are only shown when they are composed of three or more vessels. Each vessel is considered to have participated in a fishery if the given fishery contributed to 10% or more of the vessel's annual revenue.

## Weighting and Color

Edges between fisheries *i* and *j* are weighted by a measure of fisheries connectivity which is proportional to the number of vessels participating in both fisheries, and the evenness with which each vessel generates revenue from fishery *i* versus fishery *j* (Fuller et al. 2017). For example, a low edge weight between the Dungeness crab and pink shrimp fisheries could indicate that a relatively small number of vessels participate in both fisheries, and/or those vessels generate a majority of their revenue from the Dungeness crab fishery.

Node size is proportional to the amount of exvessel revenue generated by the fishery across all vessels in the network, within a given crab year. The color of each node indicates the gear type used in the fishery (with "No Fishing", "Other Port" alternatives in gray).

## Splitting the Fishing Season

We refer to each commercial fishing season using “crab years,” which span from November through October of the following year. For example, the 2016 crab year corresponds to the 2015-16 fishing season (i.e. Nov. 2015 - Oct. 2016). To observe behavioral responses during and immediately after the 2016 closures, we further subset each crab year into an early and a late season delineated by the dates of the 2016 closures. Spatial variation was observed at a regional level. The dates used to split the fish ticket data for each region and crab year were as follows:
